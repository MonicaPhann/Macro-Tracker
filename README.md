**Fun little project to apply Operation Research/Linear Programing to real-world Problems.**

This is a Macro Tracker that takes a users weight fitness goal (lose, maintain, or gain weight) to calculate their daily macronutrient needs (protein, carbohydrates, fat).
The program then takes this data and uses Linear Programming to determine the most cost-effective combination of a limited set of foods to meet the users nutritional needs. _ The data is displayed in grams and dollars._

The **objective** is to find the minimal total cost while meeting constraints of a balanced meal and the users fitness goal.

In the **future** I plan on adding a way to load dynamic food options from a CSV or external dataset. This will help with adding more diverse foods, making the nutritional date more reasonable.
I will also add user preferences and dietary restrictions, as well as display the data and results.
